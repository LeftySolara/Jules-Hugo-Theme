# Jules' Hugo Theme

This is my personal, custom Hugo theme.

## Features

### Colorscheme

This theme uses [Catppuccin Latte](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catppuccin/catppuccin/main/assets/previews/latte.webp) for its light colorscheme and [Catppuccin Frappe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catppuccin/catppuccin/main/assets/previews/frappe.webp) for its dark colorscheme. Code blocks use [Catppuccin Frappe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catppuccin/catppuccin/main/assets/previews/frappe.webp) as well.

### Assets (CSS/Sass/JS)

The following are enabled when running in production:

- [minification](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/minification/) of CSS: makes the assets' size as small as possible
- [fingerprint/integrity check](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/fingerprint/): makes fetching the assets more secure
